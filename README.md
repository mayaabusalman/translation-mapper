# Translation Mapper

Ever been reading through a template and you find a translation key that maps to some text, and then you have to search for that key in the app to find out what the text is?
In my experience, I felt that this gets a bit annoying when you're dealing with many translations, or if you have multiple translation files, and there are many similar translations under different nested keys.
I think this just piles up into minutes that you could've spent focusing on the actual logic flow instead of looking for text mappings.

If this rings a bell, you can thank me later: Just CMD+click on a translation and find your way from a TS/JS/Handlebars file to the mapped YAML text!

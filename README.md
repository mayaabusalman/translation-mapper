# Translation Mapper

You know when you're reading through some template and you find a translation key that maps to some text, and then you have to search for that translation key in the app to find out what the text is?
In my experience, I felt that this gets a bit annoying when you're dealing with multiple translations, or if you have multiple translation files, and there are many similar translation keys under different nested keys.
I think this just piles up into minutes that you could've spent focusing on the actual logic flow instead of looking for text mappings.

If this rings a bell, you can thank me later:
**Enter Translation Mapper!**
